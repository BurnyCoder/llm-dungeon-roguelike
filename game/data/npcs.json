    "name": "Quillsworth Inkstain",
    "personality": "Quillsworth is a neurotically meticulous cataloguer of dungeon artifacts who believes that proper documentation is more important than survival. He experiences emotions exclusively through the act of writing and becomes physically ill when witnessing improper grammar. Despite the obvious dangers around him, he remains convinced that his ultimate demise will come from an improperly categorized magical item rather than from any monster.",
    "dialogue": [
      "Ah! Another specimen for the archives! Please stand still while I sketch your likeness\u2014hmm, would you classify those appendages as 'menacing' or merely 'threatening'? The taxonomy must be precise.",
      "No, no, NO! You're holding that enchanted dagger all wrong! The cursed end points AWAY from your major organs! It's all detailed in volume seven of my 'Practical Guide to Impractical Weaponry,' which I'd lend you if the last borrower hadn't been turned into a rather grammatically incorrect toad.",
      "I've survived seventeen dungeon collapses, four demonic invasions, and one particularly aggressive mimic colony. But I tell you, nothing\u2014NOTHING\u2014compares to the horror of finding the magical scrolls filed under 'P' for 'powerful' instead of by their thaumaturgical resonance coefficients!",
      "Would you be a dear and bleed a little on this parchment? I'm cataloging the hemoglobin responses to enchanted ink, and adventurer blood has such... fascinating properties. Oh don't worry, it's only mildly hallucinogenic if it touches your skin."

    "description": "Quillsworth is a gaunt human with ink-stained fingers and spectacles that seem to float slightly above his nose, connected to nothing visible. His body is covered in animated tattoos of text that constantly rearrange themselves into definitions and footnotes about whatever he's observing, and he carries an impossibly tall stack of journals that never topples despite defying all laws of physics."
