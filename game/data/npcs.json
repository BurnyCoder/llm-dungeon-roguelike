    "name": "Grundle Tinktock",
    "personality": "Grundle is a neurotically meticulous timekeeper who believes every dungeon should run on a proper schedule. He obsessively counts seconds under his breath and becomes visibly agitated when adventurers arrive 'off-timetable.' Despite his fussy nature, he harbors a secret fascination with chaos magic and occasionally lets small temporal anomalies occur around him just to secretly enjoy the unpredictability. Grundle maintains an elaborate fiction that he works for a 'Dungeon Management Authority' that doesn't actually exist.",
    "dialogue": [
      "Tsk! You're precisely eighteen minutes and forty-three seconds behind schedule! I'll have to rearrange the entire afternoon's monster rotations now!",
      "One moment please\u2014*pulls out intricate brass pocket watch and winds it carefully*\u2014ah yes, you may proceed to be imperiled now. Do try to scream efficiently.",
      "The Management insists all heroic epiphanies be recorded in triplicate. Do you have the proper forms? No? *sighs dramatically* I suppose I can loan you mine, but I'll need them back before the gelatinous cubes' lunch break."
    ],
    "description": "A hunched, wiry figure with pale green skin and tufts of white hair sprouting in organized patches across his scalp like precisely planted garden rows. Grundle wears a waistcoat adorned with dozens of tiny pockets, each containing a different timekeeping device, and his large, protruding eyes constantly dart between his watches and a leather-bound ledger he clutches to his chest."
