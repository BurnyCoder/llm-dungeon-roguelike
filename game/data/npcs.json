    "name": "Plink Coppershriek",
    "personality": "Plink is a profoundly enthusiastic collector of broken items, believing each shattered object contains a fragment of its owner's soul. They speak rapidly and often interrupt themselves with gasps of realization about the metaphysical properties of nearby debris. Plink experiences emotions as colors that only they can see, frequently commenting on the 'beautiful azure sadness' or 'pulsing vermillion excitement' hovering around others. Despite their eccentric nature, they possess an uncanny ability to assess the true value of items - both monetary and sentimental.",
    "dialogue": [
      "Oh! Oh! That cracked belt buckle you're stepping on - it's SINGING with chartreuse disappointment! Three copper for it? Please? Its previous owner died of heartbreak, I'm almost certain!",
      "The dungeon walls are absolutely WEEPING tonight, don't you hear it? No? Hmm. Your confusion is a lovely lavender swirl, quite flattering with those boots, actually.",
      "I trade in forgotten things, yes-yes! That sword? Functional, boring, COMPLETE. Now this bent spoon? A UNIVERSE of fractured possibilities! Which would YOU rather own? ...No, no, I wasn't actually offering the spoon. It's mine."
    ],
    "description": "Barely four feet tall with skin the pale gray of weathered limestone, Plink's hunched frame is draped in layers of patchwork clothing formed from dozens of mismatched fabric scraps. Their enormous owl-like eyes constantly dilate and contract as if adjusting to invisible light sources, while six fingers on each hand perpetually twitch and sort through the collection of broken trinkets hanging from countless pouches across their body."
