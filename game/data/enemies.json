    "name": "Whisperlamp",
    "personality": "Curious and methodical, it's attracted to sounds and movement patterns it hasn't cataloged before. It will follow adventurers at a distance, recording their behaviors with soft clicks and luminescent pulses. If threatened, it releases stored sound as weaponized echoes. Oddly, it seems to be conducting some form of research.",

    "description": "A floating gelatinous orb about the size of a human head, containing suspended crystalline structures that glow with soft blue-green light. Thin tendrils of light occasionally extend from its body, retracting when touched. Its translucent body reveals shadow-like movements inside that don't correspond to anything in the external environment.",

    "name": "Whisperleaf",
    "personality": "Curious and melodic, the Whisperleaf is fascinated by adventurers rather than automatically hostile. It communicates through subtle leaf vibrations that create haunting tunes. It attacks only when touched or when it witnesses violence, seeing itself as a guardian of peaceful energy exchanges in the dungeon.",
    "hp": 18,
    "attack": 6,
    "description": "A spindly humanoid figure composed of translucent green fibers with tiny leaves sprouting along its limbs. Its 'face' is a hollow depression with swirling mist inside, occasionally forming simple expressions. Small root-like tendrils serve as feet, leaving tiny fluorescent marks that fade after minutes.",

    "name": "Whispering Inksmudge",
    "personality": "Manifests from forgotten tales and discarded manuscripts. Obsessively collects snippets of language, repeating overheard phrases back in distorted echoes. Shows unusual fascination with adventurers' journals and will temporarily retreat to 'digest' new words it encounters.",
    "hp": 18,
    "attack": 7,
    "description": "A shimmering, semi-transparent entity resembling spilled ink that's gained sentience. Its form constantly shifts between vaguely humanoid and abstract calligraphy. Small pieces of parchment orbit its core, and written words occasionally materialize briefly across its surface before dissolving back into its inky body.",
    "behavior": "territorial"
