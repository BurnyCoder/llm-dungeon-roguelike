    "name": "Glimwort",
    "personality": "Curious and obsessively collecting. Approaches adventurers with childlike wonder, attempting to pluck off a button, lock of hair, or small item before retreating.

    "attack": 6,
    "description": "A luminescent fungoid humanoid standing knee-high. Its body appears to be made of translucent amber gel with thousands of tiny blinking lights suspended within. Instead of arms, it has four tentacle-like appendages ending in delicate filaments. Wears a patchwork 'coat' made of stolen trinkets, buttons, and scraps bound together by luminous threads.",

    "description": "A translucent, crystalline entity about the size of a cat with an ever-shifting geometry of hexagonal facets. Its core pulses with soft bioluminescence that changes color based on its mood (blue when calm, yellow when curious, red when threatened). Small crystalline appendages float around it in an orbital pattern, occasionally detaching to interact with objects of interest.",

    "description": "A translucent origami-like entity that hovers slightly above the ground.
