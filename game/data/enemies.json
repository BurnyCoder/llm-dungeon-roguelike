    "name": "Mist Whisperer",
    "personality": "Intensely curious about organic life, constantly collecting tiny samples of travelers by absorbing microscopic skin flakes. Communicates in hushed crackling sounds resembling static. Will follow adventurers at a distance, sometimes helping by clearing minor obstacles if it finds the travelers' journey 'interesting enough to document'.",

    "attack": 7,
    "description": "A translucent, vaguely humanoid entity composed of roiling vapor with a faint blue-green luminescence. Three distinct denser patches of mist form what appear to be sensory organs. Small collected particles from previous encounters float suspended within its form, occasionally rearranging into rudimentary patterns that mimic nearby creatures.",

    "name": "Luminault",
    "personality": "Curious and childlike, the Luminault is fascinated by reflective objects and will pause combat to investigate anything shiny. It communicates through soft bell-like tones and seems to experience emotions in reverse - laughing when injured and appearing distressed when finding treasure.",

    "attack": 7,
    "description": "A floating crystalline entity resembling a jellyfish made of translucent blue glass. Its bell-shaped body contains a pulsing light that shifts colors with its mood. Three primary tentacles end in small mirror-like surfaces that it uses to collect and redirect ambient light. Cracks along its surface reveal glimpses of a swirling starry void within.",

    "name": "Glimmershard",
    "personality": "Curious and obsessively collecting. Follows adventurers silently, stealing small shiny objects while humming discordant tunes. Becomes enraged if its collection is threatened, but otherwise content to observe from a distance. Can become fixated on particularly reflective armor or weapons.",
    "hp": 18,
    "attack": 6,
    "description": "A crystalline humanoid standing three feet tall with a translucent body that refracts light in unpredictable patterns. Its limbs terminate in sharp prismatic points, and where a face should be is only a swirling vortex of colored light. Small stolen trinkets float suspended within its hollow interior.",
