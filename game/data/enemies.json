    "name": "Murmuring Veilworm",
    "personality": "Eerily curious and constantly whispering mathematical equations. It's drawn to patterns and will sometimes pause mid-combat to trace geometric shapes in the air. When injured, it doesn't express pain but rather fascination at its own mortality, as if experiencing a novel theorem.",
    "hp": 18,
    "attack": 6,
    "description": "A translucent, cylindrical creature roughly the size of a human arm. Its body consists of overlapping transparent membranes that ripple with faint luminescent symbols. No discernible face exists, yet hundreds of tiny vibrating filaments at one end produce a continuous mathematical murmuring. It moves by contracting and expanding, leaving behind a faint trail of glowing moisture.",

    "name": "Whisperdust",
    "personality": "Driven by intense curiosity, Whisperdusts collect and catalog small objects, arranging them in perfect geometric patterns. They communicate through pulsing light patterns and are fascinated by adventurers' equipment. They become hostile only when their carefully arranged collections are disturbed or when they desperately want to 'sample' a piece of unique gear.",
    "hp": 15,
    "attack": 6,
    "description": "A floating crystalline entity resembling a translucent jellyfish made of dust and light. Its core pulses with bioluminescent particles that shift color based on its mood. Six tendrils of sparkling dust extend from its body, each ending in a small crystalline 'hand' capable of manipulating objects with surprising precision.",
    "behavior": "territorial"

    "name": "Lumigloat",
    "personality": "Curious but easily startled. Collects shiny objects and arranges them in geometric patterns. When threatened, it emits melodic humming that increases in pitch with its stress level. Tends to mirror the movements of adventurers before attacking.",
    "hp": 18,
    "attack": 6,
    "description": "A translucent jellyfish-like creature that hovers slightly above ground. Its bell-shaped body pulses with soft bioluminescence that shifts between pale blue and green. Instead of tentacles, it has five spiraling appendages that end in tiny crystalline structures. Its single eye is located oddly on its underside, rotating a full 360 degrees.",
